## BrickStore database

This repository consists of a GitHub Actions workflow that regenerates BrickStore's database.
A successful action run is automatically released on GitHub and is then instantly available for BrickStore clients to download.

Any data downloaded from
 * www.bricklink.com is owned by BrickLink (all catalog data).
 * www.rebrickable.com is owned by Rebrickable (color mappings).
 * www.ldraw.org is owned by LDraw.org (color definition).

Please see https://www.brickstore.dev for more information on the actual application.
